# Ultimate++

Ultimate++ is a C++ cross-platform rapid application development framework focused on programmers productivity. It includes a set of libraries (GUI, SQL, etc.), and an integrated development environment.

Rapid development is achieved by the [smart and aggressive use of C++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$overview$en-us.html) rather than through fancy code generators. In this respect, U++ competes with popular scripting languages while preserving C/C++ runtime characteristics.

The U++ integrated development environment, TheIDE, introduces modular concepts to C++ programming. It features BLITZ-build technology to speedup C++ rebuilds up to 4 times, Visual designers for U++ libraries, a [Topic++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$Topic$en-us.html) system for documenting code and creating rich text resources for applications (like help and code documentation) and [Assist++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$Assist$en-us.html) - a powerful C++ code analyzer that provides features like code completion, navigation and transformation.

TheIDE can work with GCC, MinGW and Visual C++ and contains a full featured debugger. TheIDE can also be used to develop non-U++ applications.

## What you can get with Ultimate++?

* A very effective C++ library for cross-platform development in source form.

* A good integrated development environment, designed for developing large C++ applications.

You can use both, or you can use whichever you need.
